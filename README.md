# mgclass
CLASS version for phenomenological modified gravity

WARNING: this code needs more extensive tests before being considered "safe"

This MGCLASS is based on the existing code by Baker and Bull
(gitlab link: https://gitlab.com/philbull/mgclass)
which implements the equations of Baker & Bull (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00641)


Some more parametrization of deviations from GR will be implemented in the
(hopefully near) future, in order to match the parametrizations of 
MGCAMB (http://aliojjati.github.io/MGCAMB/) and to cross-check the two codes.
